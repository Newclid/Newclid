    "# Applying Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often the case for geometry problems fed to Newclid that they cannot be solved right away with the initial information. The way to expand its reasoning, from the introduction of the JGEX system, was to mimic the human strategy of \"adding an auxiliary point\" to the problem, in order to be able to justify new logical developments. The most successful way to date to generate those new points is to do it with the help of a trained language model capable of processing JGEX problems and proposing new points in case Newclid can't solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of JGEX though, language models were not available. And even today they are very costly and not as easily accessible as Newclid itself. This creates an incentive to the development of human heuristics for the suggestions of auxiliary points, that is, scripted ways to suggest those new points and try to solve problems without having to call for the help of large language models.\n",

    "In this tutorial we show how to test the heuristics that are built in Newclid."
